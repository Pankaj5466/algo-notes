\chapter{Search Algorihtms}{\label{ch:binary_search}}

Binary Search is search algorithm that reduces the normal O(n) complexiy of search to logarithmic log(n).

To binary search we need to sort our input first. There are different sorting algorithm, a few of which are listed below.
\begin{compactenum}
    \item insertion sort
    \item bubble sort
    \item merge sort | Based on Divide and Conquere
    \item quick sort | Based on Divide and Conquere
    \item Radix sort
    \item \dots
\end{compactenum}

\begin{exercise}[Binary Search Fundamental Question List:]
    Given a sorted array write the code for following:
    \lipsum[3]
   \begin{compactenum}
        \item Check if element exist or not.
        \item If the element exist, return it's index.
        \item 
   \end{compactenum}
\end{exercise}
