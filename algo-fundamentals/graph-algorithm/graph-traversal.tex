\section{Graph Traversal}

Both BFS and DFS go through the graph and process each node once. But they do it in different order.
The question is what they are going to do when they go through the node.

Sometimes they can do a very complexity things, which result in different algorithms. All graph algorithm usages bfs/dfs and do different task while going through node, which result in different algorithm.

The data strucutre that go with BFS is queue, the data strucutre that go with DFS is stack.

\marginnote{DFS has much more use than BFS due to its recursive structure.}

\rfl{The key thing about DFS is that, it start going down first, so when it backs its way up, it go so much information, that  the node which has called it can use this data to process node and make decision.}
