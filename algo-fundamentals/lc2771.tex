\begin{problem}{LC2771 Longest Non-decreasing Subarray From Two Arrays}
    You are give two array A and B of size n. $(n <= 10^5)$. Your task is to return the \textbf{maximum subarray length} in third array C. Where for c[i] in the range [0, n - 1], you can assign either A[i] or B[i].

    \footnotetext{Excellent Problem depicting key concept of recursion + past state in dp + subsequence vs subarray in recursion.}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}[Recursion | Ways at idx(aka Inclusion-Exclusion)]

    Like all recursio problem subarray problem are not different.
    The only differance they posses from subsequence is that their element must be picked continously. We can include this informatin into pastState variable and code our solution.

    \medskip
    \intution{let $f(idx,pstate):=$ maximum subarray length if we are allowed to use arr[idx...size-1]  ONLY.}

    \medskip
    \rfl{Now as this is a state problem, each of the operation has a constrain applied to them.}

    \medskip
    For this problem, we have following options:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item \icode{int val1}: take from A. \\Restriction: can only be taken if its form a increasing subarray
        \item \icode{int val2}: take from B. \\Restriction: can only be taken if its form a increasing subarray
        \item \icode{int val3}: do not take.\\ 
        Restriction(subarray): for subarray problem, for this to happen we must have not picked any element previously.\\
        Restriction(subsequence):
        For subseqeunce problem, there will be no restriction on this.
    \end{enumerate}

    Follow-Up and  Pratice problems:
    \begin{asparaenum}[(a)]
        \item Follow Up 1: Can you modify the above algorithm so that f(idx,pstate) defination changes as. \icode{f(idx,pstate)=  Maximum lenght of subarray that start at idx. and} \rfl{must include idx}
        \item Can you implement the same code when we go from right to left in recurison. ie we start with \icode{f(n,pstate)} and its state depends upon n-1. (this is not much important, but just for case you should know that we can code this way also.)
        
        \item Can you devise iterative solution follwing the above code?
        \item Can you devise iterative solution following the follow-up-1 code.
        
        \item How will you modify the solution if there are k arrays to chose from?? What will the time comlexity?
        \item Explain how the solution changes if the question was about finding subsequence instead of subarray. Justify your logic and  code it.
        \item For subsequnce problem, justify why code complexity increases to $O(n*n)$ where for array it was just $O(n*3)$
        \item Their exist a patience sorting algorith for longest incerasing subsequence. which gives the lenght of lcs in $O(n*log(n))$ time. Which is better that our current $O(n^2)$ solution. Discuss how the question can be modified to force us use the patience sorting for lcs.

    Hints for follow up:
    \begin{asparaenum}[(a)]
        \item Follow Up 1: if you remove the variable \icode{val3},  then \icode{f(idx,pstate)} changes such that it contains the maxium lenght that MUST stat from idx. and MUST include idx. \rfl{to get the answer now, you will need to have gmx}
