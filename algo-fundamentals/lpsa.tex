        TO-DO: Remove parenthesis guides hints.
        
        \item First try with generating all substring. Can you do it in $O(n^2)$ ?

        \item
        If you define your problem statement with l..r range. You have the following defination \verb|f(l,r):= | length of longest valid palindromic substring when you are allowed to use \verb|arr[l..r]| \textbf{only}. \\
        The drawback of this is that it convert your complexity to $O(n^2)$

        \item
        \rfl{If you can define what will be the increment during inclusion of idx. Then you can use Inclusion-Exclusion pattern to solve this problem.}
        
        way1: \verb|f(idx,_):=| lenght of longest palindormic subarray when we are allowed to use $arr[0..idx]$ \textbf{only}.

        way2: \verb|f(idx,_):=| length of longest palindromic subarray ending at idx \textbf{that must include idx}. (OR startign at idx and must include idx). 

       \intution{As we know way1 is preferred with subsequence problem and way2 is preferred for subarray problem.}
       Lets try to solve current subarray via way2.

       \item Can you think of a solution using stack?
       
       \item Can you think of a solution that usages expand around center approach?
       
       \item Do you know about Manacher's Algorithm? Which solves this problem in linear time.
