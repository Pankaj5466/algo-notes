\begin{problem}{Trapping Rain Water}
    Given n non-negative integers representing height of building in one-dimension. Assuming width of each building as 1unit. Compute how much water will be trapped by these building.

\end{problem}

\begin{solution}[solution summary]
    There are various ways to solve this problem.

    \begin{guide}

        \item For current building, if you could find what is leftmost building which is just greator than arr[i] and what is rightmost building which is just greator then arr[i]. (i.e previousGreatorElement + nextGreatorElement).
        
        Then, water trapped by arr[i] would be \verb|min(pg,ng)-arr[i]|

        Try to use DP to calculate pgarr and ngarr.

        \item Can you use stack to find pg and ng for arr[i]?
        
        \item Can you try to use two-pointer?

\begin{solution}[Stack | O(n)]
    Lets use stack to solve this problem.
