\begin{exercise}[Most Important Concept]
    \begin{description}
    \item [Dynamic Programming:] Has a lot of variation, but basic is same. i.i to caculate the answer via recursion first, then memoize or further optimize then memoize.
    
        \begin{compactenum}[(a)]
            \item dp without state: subset sum,coin change
            \item dp with l,r pointer: longest palindromic string,longest valid parenthesis
            \item dp with l,r and k: matrix chain multiplication, burst bullon
            
            \item dp with state: stock problem series, paint fence, smallest possible team.
            \item memoization with backtracking
            
            \item palindromic pattern 
            \item valid parenthesis pattern 
        \end{compactenum}

    \item[Tree Algorithms:] Tree has various problem bases on them.
        \begin{compactenum}[(a)]
            \item tree traversal. (inorder,preorder,postorder)
            \item tree traversal level order, zig zag level order, 
            \item LCA, root to leaf path, diagmeter of tree, is tree symmetrical, is tree mirror image
        \end{compactenum}

    \item[Trie Implementation:] Implement trie bases on knowlege of tree.
    
    \item[Graph Algorithms:] Refer Shai Simonson graph copy notes.(its sufficent)

        \item Number of disconnected compoonent.
        \item TO-DO: add more
    \end{compactenum}

    \item[Stack:] To check if monotonic can be applied to problem, checkif finding NGL,NGR will help you solve the problem.
        \begin{compactenum}[a]
            \item implement monotonic stack, slope of monotonic stack
            \item minimum element contricution in monotonic increasing stack, max element contricution in monotonic decreasing stack.
            \item NGL,NGR; NSL,NSR calcualtion. 
            
            \item stack supporting basic + getMin: solution using two stack, solution using single variable.
            \item implement stack using queue.
        \end{compactenum}


        \item[Binary Search:] There are a lot of various and this usually can combine with any other algorihtm.
            \begin{compactenum}[a]
                \item Recursive binary search code, iterative binary search code
                \item implement lowerbound, implement upperbound
                \item implement find,lowerbound,infliction point when array is rotated or shifted.
            \end{compactenum}
