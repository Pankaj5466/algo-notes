# How to pratice?
Viewing directly the theory/solution, it will lower the cognitive ability.
So suggest below steps:

> check course/books for references and for all the availale options. Do not check it for revision or remembering.
> To pratice again, draw the outline first by thinking on copy and paper. If you think you miss the topic, then check the outline of it only.

> to pratice the specific chapter, again write down the chapter outline. Then explain each one one of them. If you think you miss some topics, then take help of notes/books/resources.
