\begin{problem}{Matrix Chain Multiplication}
    Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together. The efficient way is the one that involves the least number of multiplications.
    The dimensions of the matrices are given in an array arr[] of size N (such that N = number of matrices + 1) where the ith matrix has the dimensions (arr[i-1] x arr[i]).

\begin{solution}
    This is another important patter of dp. 
    In this, generally the size of array be such that we require $O(n^3)$ time complexiy to solve the question.

   \begin{marginnote}
    The $O(n^3)$ complexity of problem itself suggest that you should try this solution.

   Here, instead of considering our question space to be [0..idx], we will consider it to be [l...r].


   And after that we will try to find our the number of ways can fill the carr[idx].

   \vspace{2mm}
   For the given problem, if we have the array at arr[l..r] and we need to find the optimal cost to multiply.
   Then we will try all possible way to multiply the matrix \& take the best amount them.
   
   \begin{verbatim}
        int matrixChainMultiplicatino(int l, int r, const vector<int>&arr)
        {
            if(l>=r)
                return 0; //no element exist in arrr

            int bCost = INT_MAX; //best cost
            
            //Try out all possible place
            for(int k=l;k<r;k++)
            {
                int leftCost =  matrixChainMultiplicatino(l,k,arr);
                int rightCost = matrixChainMultiplicatino(k+1,r,arr);

                cc printf("(%d,%d):: LeftCost = %d, RightCost = %d\n",l,r,leftCost,rightCost);

                int splittingCost = (arr[l-1] * arr[k] * arr[r]) + leftCost + rightCost;

                bCost = min(bCost,splittingCost);
            }
        //  printf("Best Cost to Multiply %d = %d\n",l,bCost);
            return bCost;
        }
   \end{verbatim}

\end{solution}

\begin{solution}
    //TO-DO: Complete this
    what if f(idx) := optimal multiplication cost when we have allowed only matrix arr[0...idx]

    for sarr[idx], the cost will depedent upon ??
\end{solution}
