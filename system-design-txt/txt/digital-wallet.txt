Today, a relational databse running on a typical data center can support few thousands transactions per second.

In which scenerio, NOP can fail. (Hint: a disabled account)

Try Confirm/Cancle (TC/C) is also called distributed transactions by compensesation.

In 2PC, all the local transactios are not done(rows still locked) when the second phase starts, while in TC/C, all local transactiosn are done(unlocked) when the second phase starts.

Saga is the de-factor standard for handling distributed transaction in a microserice architecute.

Event sourcing required the behaviour of the state machine to be deterministic. Therefore machine cannot allow random thing from outside  or inside to modify the system.

when everyghin is file based, the system can fully utilize the maximum I/O throughtput of the underlaying computer hardware.
