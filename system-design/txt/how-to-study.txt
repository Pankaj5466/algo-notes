First understand that, you don't need to remember everything while reading a topic.

During the reading, the MOST IMPORTANT thing is to relate the things to real-life and feel motivated as why certain things are done that way! Basically either be genune interested or create interest during study so that mind understand the concept rather than just trying to memorize it.

While you don't need to remember everything, you certainly need to remember the outline.

Use this outline you remembered to recall main concepts. Then small detials about each outline you mind will itself recall if they were related to the outline.
